= Limitations of the lite version =
The most features are available but you cannot select every option. You will find a small notice for each unavailable option on the settings page. The maximal number of encyclopedia terms is limited to twelve.


== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =
* WordPress 3.6 or greater
* PHP version 5.3 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you do not need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Encyclopedia, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "Encyclopedia" and click "Search Plugins". Once you have found my plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install now".

= Manual installation =
The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =
Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I embed the term archive page in my website? =
At Encyclopedia settings page (Dashboard -> Settings -> Encyclopedia) you will find the archive link for your Encyclopedia in the right sidebar box named "Archive URL". Copy the first link and paste it anywhere on your website, for example in a menu or a sidebar widget. Use the second link if you want to embed an RSS feed for Encyclopedia archive.

= How do I create relations between my Encyclopedia terms? =
To create relations between your terms you need to classify your terms by using tags.

= Can Encyclopedia display and sort terms in other than Latin characters? =
Yes, Encyclopedia can handle every existing character. All strings are handled as UTF8. So it works for Arabian, Russian, Chinese, Turkish, and all other UTF8 compliant languages.

= Is it possible to search for Encyclopedia terms only? =
Yes, it is. For this purpose place the "Encyclopedia Search" Widget in a sidebar of your choice. The search result will display Encyclopedia terms only.

= What can I do when I have problems with installing or setting up the Encyclopedia? =
First of all read the installation guide on this site. Follow the guide step by step. If you do so and still have problems, there could be an incompatibility with another plugin: Deactivate all other plugins, try to install/set up Encyclopedia again. If it works re-activate plugin by plugin again to see which one causes the problem. If you need personal assistance or coaching or if you want us to install and set up Encyclopedia on your website, please contact us via [support form](http://dennishoppe.de/en/support) on our website (this is a business service and you need to buy the support package to make use of it).

= Does Encyclopedia display tool tips when hovering linked terms in my contents? =
Maybe: The linked encyclopedia terms have a title tag which displays the excerpt of the term description. If you hover it with your mouse you can see it. If your theme supports tool tips it will show the term description as tool tip. If you need this implemented please use our [support form](http://dennishoppe.de/en/support).
